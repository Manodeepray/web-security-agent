Task: 2. Search for a contact using the search form on the contacts page
Workflow:
Step 1: Navigate to the contacts page by accessing the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/contacts.
Step 2: Locate the search form on the contacts page with the action URL '/contacts/search' and method 'GET'.
Step 3: Fill in the search query input field (type='text', name='query') with the desired search term.
Step 4: Locate the submit button with type='submit' and text=' Search', and press it to submit the search form.
Step 5: The search results will be displayed on the same page or potentially redirected to a new page based on the application's behavior, and the automation agent can then parse the results to verify the search was successful.
